This website is for disseminating SDG indicator data. We are at an Alpha stage in development, so the site is still 'work in progress'.

Other countries wishing to reuse this site's underlying platform are welcome to do so for free. Our [Guidance page]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance/) highlights key information on how to do this, linking to detailed technical instructions available in the platform's [documentation](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io). The [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) can also provide guidance and support through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/).

If you have any feedback on this website or SDG data then please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>. The answers to some frequently asked questions are also available in our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/).
